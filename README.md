Cards for Humanity
===========
<h3>Brief Non-Technical Description </h3> 
<p>Cards for Humanity is a polished web version of the popular card game Cards Against Humanity. 
As much as we like receiving, when possible, we also like to give. Cards for Humanity allows you 
to donate to children in need - all while remaining as despicable and awkward as you naturally are.

<h3> Challenges </h3> 
<p> 
<a href="http://www.tylermcginnis.com">Tyler McGinnis</a>: I was mostly in charge of creating a wonderful 
user experience inside the game itself. We're not nieve and we realized that odds are, the majority of our users
would be playing on a mobile device from inside a bathroom stall. Because of this, it was necessary that 
the experience on mobile was just as amazing as the one on a desktop. To do this, I built our main app on a fluid 
layout then used some media queries to take care of some things on Mobile phones. Overall I'm confident that no matter
what device you're, you're going to have an awesome time.
